        <h2>Thanks for coming by! We have a very interesting project at the moment.</h2>
        <h2>About the project:</h2>
        <p>We are currently working on forms of buoyant force gravity cancellation projects. They are designed so that a floatation object, usually a piece of wood is lifted by the buoyant force. An object which the force of gravity cancels out on is then attached to the buoyant object, and it is cancelled out by the two forces.</p>
        <h2>A very cool video:</h2>
        <video src="buoyancyvid.mp4" height="400px" alt="Our buoyancy project!" controls autoplay></video>
        <p>In the video, an eraser replicating a meteorite is dropped onto the suspended object. This is designed to create a meteorite simulation.</p>
