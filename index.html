        <h2>A brief introduction to Aliver Sims</h2>
        <p>Aliver Sims (Simulations) is a zero gravity simulator company. We are currently working on forms of buoyant force gravity cancellation projects. They are designed so that a floatation object, usually a piece of wood is lifted by the buoyant force. An object which the force of gravity cancels out on is then attached to the buoyant object, and it is cancelled out by the two forces. This can also be achieved with gravity and helium (or hydrogen but that would be dangerous). Thanks for reading about Aliver Sims, and you can check out some of our projects below</p>
